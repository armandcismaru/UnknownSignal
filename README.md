# UnknownSignal
Data Driven CS Coursework, Python code that reconstructs signals based on points generated by their functions.
## Abstract
This project uses the least squares rehression method to reconstruct segments from points that were generated with either a linear, polynomial of grade 3 or a sinus function. The sinus function and the grade of the polynomial had to be found and demontrated as explained in the report.

K-fold cross-validation was used in order to mitigate overfitting and to choose between the three types of functions.

## Report

The [report](../DataDriven_CW_Report) can be found here. 

## Usage instructions

The code takes in points in a .csv file. Train files can be found [here](../datafiles/train_data). Each file contains one or more segments, each representing a function out of those three stated above. The code runs as follows:

`$ python lsr.py basic_2.csv --plot` 

Note that the `--plot` argument is optional and facilitates visual observation of the reconstructed signal. The `basic_2.csv` can be any of the files found [here](../datafiles/train_data).

The program then outputs the total reconstruction error across all segments in the file, e.g. `6.467081701001855e-27`.
